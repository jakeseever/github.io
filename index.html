    <p id="aboutJake">My name is Jake Seever and I am an aspiring web developer from central Wisconsin.
      I have graduated from Northcentral Technical College with an Associate Degree in IT-Web Design.
       I also work at NTC and really enjoy my job. I manage the Information Technology Entrepreneurial Center (iTEC) and its employees.
       This is a place where IT students come to receive academic help and technical support. I am currently pursuing my Bachelor’s Degree
       in Web Development through Bellevue University. I enjoy playing sports like baseball, softball, golf, basketball, and volleyball when
       the opportunity presents itself. I also enjoy being outdoors and doing things like camping, fishing, having bonfires, and swimming when
        I have time. I like the challenge of fixing things. I haven’t ever recalled a repair man in my entire life. I repair my vehicles, appliances,
        electronics, plumbing, heating, and generally whatever stops working correctly. I am good at taking things apart and figuring out how the
        work with just a bit of additional research. One day I hope to be able to work remotely so that I may travel more and see more of the world.
